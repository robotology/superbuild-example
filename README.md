This project is an example of a basic superbuild.

The superbuild compiles two subprojets which are hosted in separate repositories. 
Download and compilation of the subprojects is done automatically by the superbuild.

Get the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:robotology/superbuild-example.git

Run cmake and make the project:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

This project supports the superbuild documentation available here:
